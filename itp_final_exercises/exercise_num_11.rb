# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why

# I really like ruby-doc.org
# I like it for two reasons. First it explains all of the ruby syntax, classes and methods very well
# and gives good examples

# I also like the search functionality that ruby-doc.org provides. 
# One can search for a specific method or class very easily 
# and understand very quickly what that method or class can be used for.
